# Wiselab Onboarding Frontend

## Overview

#### First of all, welcome to **Wisemen!** We are happy to have you here and we hope you will have a great time working with us.


  <img width="200" src="img/projectSetup/Wisemen_Logo_Acid.png">


Welcome to the frontend onboarding! In this onboarding you will learn how frontend development happens at Wisemen.
You will learn how to work with Vue, Vite, Tailwind, Figma, Github, Jira and more.

This onboarding is designed to be completed in roughly 3-4 days.
This does not mean you have to complete it in 3-4 days. People with more experience will be able to complete it faster than people with less experience.

You will be working on a small to-do app.
This app will be used to learn the same way we, as front-end developers work at Wisemen. You will be working with the tools we use at Wisemen and you will be working with the same workflow.

> aside positive
> One important thing to know is that you will be creating most stuff from scratch in this codelab.
> This is to make sure you understand how everything works and how the pieces are connected behind the scenes.
> When we create projects for our customers we always start from our [project template](https://github.com/wisemen-digital/project-template-vue).
> The project template contains pre-built features, components, views, tools and configurations so that we can get started quickly and don't have to reinvent the wheel every time we start a new project.

We also expect you to make pull request of your work so your buddy can review your code and keep track of your progress.
The way we do this will be explained in the onboarding.

Good luck on becoming the front-end developer you are meant to be!

## Prerequisites

### IDE

There are 2 different IDE's you can use to work with Vue. You can use either **Visual Studio Code** or **WebStorm**. The Choice is yours, so choose wisely.

#### WebStorm

WebStorm is a JavaScript IDE with complete set of tools for client-side and server-side development and testing.
It provides code completion, on-the-fly error detection, powerful navigation and refactoring for JavaScript, TypeScript,
CSS, HTML and more.

Webstorm is a paid IDE. You can get a license from Wisemen. Ask your buddy!

[Download WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download)

Handy Plugins:
- **Atom Material Icons** (cool file and folder icons)
- **Bitbucket pull** requests (The plugin allows you to review Atlassian Bitbucket pull requests right in the IDE.)
- **GitHub CoPilot** (AI pair programmer)
- **Easy i18n** (i18n support in WebStorm)
- **IntelliVue** (Vue.js support for WebStorm)


#### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.
It includes support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.

Visual Studio Code is a free IDE. You can download it from the website.

[Download vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Handy Plugins:
- **Volar** (processing vue files)
- **ESLint** (code formatting)
- **Error lens** (showing errors in the code)
- **Guthub Copilot** (AI pair programmer)
- **I18n ally** (i18n support in vscode, managing translations)
- **Pretty Typescript Errors** (formatting ts errors so they are more readable)
- **Tailwind CSS intellisense** (tailwind css support)
- **VSCode-icons** (cool file and folder icons)
- **TODO tree** (showing all the TODO's in the project)
- **Vitest** (running tests)
- **GitLens** (git support)

Choose the IDE you want to work with and download it.

### Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment
that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

Node.js is necessary to run the Vue project. You can download it from the website.

[Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### NPM vs PNPM

* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
  NPM is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. The NPM program is installed on
  Node.js when you install it from its website.

* [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation)
  PNPM is a fast, disk space efficient package manager. 
* It is designed to be installed globally, and it installs all the packages that you need in your project in a single place, using symlinks.

The difference between NPM and PNPM is that PNPM uses symlinks to link packages to your project. 
This means that if you have multiple projects that use the same package, it will only be installed once on your computer. 
This saves a lot of disk space. PNPM is also faster than NPM because it uses symlinks.

### Figma

Our designers work with **Figma**.
Figma is a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool which is browser-based or can be installed on macOS or Windows.
We recommend you to install the desktop app.

[Download Figma](https://www.figma.com/downloads/)

Take a look around in Figma and try to get familiar with the tool. You will be using it a lot in the future.
You can view all of our designs here:

[Wisemen Figma](https://www.figma.com/files/team/1070403287155222588/Wisemen?fuid=1070747045190465434)

To access the designs you need to log in with your Wisemen account:

### BitBucket repository

Bitbucket is a web-based version control repository hosting service owned by Atlassian, for source code and development
projects that use the Git revision control system.

Some of our older projects will be hosted on BitBucket.

[Wisemen BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product)

If you are not yet familiar with Bitbucket and/or Git, Here is great article to get you started:
[Bitbucket Git tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)

We also expect you to make pull request of your work so your buddy can review your code and keep track of your progress.
In the article above you can find a section about pull requests to get you started!

### GitHub

GitHub is another web-based version control repository hosting service owned by Microsoft, for source code and development
projects that use the Git revision control system.

Just like BitBucket, some of our projects will be hosted on GitHub. **_GitHub will be used for new projects_**.

If you are not yet familiar with GitHub, Here is great article to get you started:
[GitHub Git tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world)

Same as with BitBucket, we expect you to make pull request of your work so your buddy can review your code and keep
track of your progress.

### Jira access

For this onboarding you will be working with Jira to track your progress. You can find the Jira board here:
[Jira Todo]()

Jira is used to track the progress of your project and manage the tasks that need to be done.
All the requirements for the to-do app are in the Jira. You will be creating tasks in the Jira to keep track of your progress.

The Jira contains all the requirements for creating the to-do app.

*ToDo: Add link to Jira*

## Project explanation

You will be creating a simple to-do app. The app can be used to create, edit and delete to-do's.
The backend is already created and you can find the documentation here:

[Backend documentation](https://onboarding-todo-api.development.appwi.se/api/v1/docs/)

Username: `appwise`  
Password: `password`

### Requirements

- Login page with email and password
- View your to-do's in a list
- Create a new to-do
- Edit a to-do
- Delete a to-do
- Mark a to-do as done

### Designs

You can find the designs here:

[Figma designs](https://www.figma.com/file/hebgv4Qx8VanMAQkO1NFpa/Onboarding-to-do?type=design&node-id=467-4945&mode=design&t=c2mb4igTcdZQaH6X-4)

## Project setup

<img width="300" src="img/projectSetup/cat_i_am_ready.gif">


### 1. A Vue3 project

We use the latest version of Vue for this project. Vue3 is the latest version and has some new features and
improvements over Vue2. You can read more about Vue3 here: [Vue3 website]('https://v3.vuejs.org/')
Make sure you use the CLI version to create the project.

---

<img width="120" src="img/projectSetup/vite_logo.png">

### 2. Vite

Vite is a new breed of frontend build tool that significantly improves the frontend development experience. It consists
of two major parts:

- A dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, for example extremely fast Hot Module
  Replacement (HMR) that updates your changes in the browser in as little as 16 milliseconds.
- A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for
  production.

#### 2.1 Config

Vite is configured using a `vite.config.js` file in the root of your project. This file is written in CommonJS format
and should export a plain JavaScript object. Make sure to change this file from `.js` to `.ts`

#### 2.2 Plugins

Vite supports a plugin system that allows you to customize the behavior of Vite itself and integrate with other tools.
Plugins can be configured in the `vite.config.js` file.

<img width="120" src="img/projectSetup/pnpm_logo.svg">
<img width="80" src="img/projectSetup/vs_icon.png">
<img width="140" src="img/projectSetup/npm_logo.png">

### 3. Package.json

The package.json file is used to give information to npm that allows it to identify the project as well as handle the
project's dependencies. npm can install the packages you specify in your package.json file.
The main use of the package.json file is to list the packages that your project depends on and to ensure that your
colleagues get the same packages when they do `npm install`.

#### 3.1 Scripts

The scripts property is used to specify a list of scripts that can be run using `npm run <script-name>`.
It's written as a JSON object where each key is the name of a script and the value is the command to run for.
Most common scripts are `start` and `build`.

#### 3.2 Dependencies vs Dev Dependencies

Dev dependencies are dependencies that are only used during development and are not required for production.
Dependencies are required for production.

<img width="120" src="img/projectSetup/tailwind_logo.png">

### 4. Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It's completely
customizable, completely extensible, and amazingly feature-rich.

#### 4.1 Tailwind config

Tailwinds config file is used to configure the framework. You can add custom colors, fonts, breakpoints and more.
This is where you can customize the framework to your needs.

👉 [Tailwind website](https://tailwindcss.com/)

<img width="120" src="img/projectSetup/ESLint_logo.png">

### 5. ESLint config

ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of
making code more consistent and avoiding bugs. Is helps a lot with code formatting and makes it easier to write code.
Also in team projects it helps to keep the code consistent.

👉 __Please make sure you use the Wisemen ESLint config file, read more
here: [The Frontend bible ESLint config](https://thefrontendbible.com/eslint-config)__

<img width="120" src="img/projectSetup/vue_i18n_logo.svg">

### 6. i18n

i18n is a short name for internationalization. It is a process of designing and developing a software application so
that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes.
Within the company we use [Vue i18n](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/) to translate our applications.
It's important to understand the power of this tool since it will save you a lot of time when creating multilingual applications.

<img width="120" src="img/projectSetup/typescript_logo.png">

### 7. What the Typescript

TypeScript is a tool that helps developers write code with fewer bugs. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript,
meaning any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. It helps a lot with type checking and makes it easier
to write code.

#### 7.1 Typescript config
The TypeScript config file is used to configure the TypeScript compiler. You can add custom types, change the
compiler options and more.

<img width="220" src="img/projectSetup/google_fonts_logo.png">

### 8. ⚠️ Google fonts ⚠️

It's important to know that we cannot use Google fonts CDN in our projects. This rule is only for public websites of
our clients.
We have alternative ways of using Google fonts in our projects.

👉 __Please read more
here: [Afstappen van Google Fonts en CDN javascript](https://appwise.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FRONT/pages/631734284/Afstappen+van+Google+Fonts+en+CDN+javascript).
If you have any questions about this, please contact your team lead.__

### 9. @ Alias for src folder

In our vue imports, we can use the @ alias to import files from the src folder. This is a lot easier than using
relative paths.
For example:

```js 
import {Button} from '@/components
``` 

instead of:

```js
import {Button} from '../../components'
```

This alias is configured in the `vite.config.js` file.
Maybe do a little research about how you can configure your vite environment to accept the usage of this alias.

### 10. Important files

#### 10.1 .env

The `.env` file is used to store environment variables. These variables can be used in your application.
It is mainly used to separate development and production variables. For example, you can use a different API url in
development than in production. Most of our projects have 3 different `.env` files: `.env.development`, `.env.staging` and `.env.production`.
Locally you can override these variables by creating a `.env.local` file. This file will be ignored by git.

`⚠️ Using an .env is not required for this project.`

#### 10.2 .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file is used to tell git which files it should ignore. For example, you don't want to commit your
node_modules folder to git. This file is used to tell git to ignore this folder.

### That's it for now! 🎉 Soak it all in and let's get started with the project setup! 🚀

<img width="400" src="img/projectSetup/look_up.gif">

## Project Structure

<img width="300" src="img/projectStructure/organized.gif">

### Folder structure

For this project we will be using a 'split-by-type' folder structure. This is recommended for small applications.

You can read more about it here: [Folder structure](https://thefrontendbible.com/project-structure)

### Assets

Assets are files that are used throughout your application. This can be images, fonts, icons, etc.

### Components

Components are the building blocks of Vue.js applications.
They are self-contained pieces of code that can be reused throughout your application.

You can read more about it here: [Components](https://thefrontendbible.com/components)

### Composable

Composable look like a util function, but the main difference is that they can contain state and leverage the
reactivity of Vue.js.

You can read more about it here: [Composables](https://thefrontendbible.com/reusable-code/composables)

### Configs

Configs are used to store configuration values for plugins/packages that are used throughout your application. 

### Constants

Constants are used to store hardcoded values that are used throughout your application.

### Icons

Icons are used to store the icons that are used throughout your application.

### Libs

Libs are used to store the libraries that are used throughout your application.

### Middlewares

Middlewares acts like a bridge between the backend and the frontend. They are used to transform the data that is
received from the backend or route protection.

### Models

Models are used to store the types and interfaces that are used throughout your application.

### Modules

Modules are collections of components, views, stores, services, etc. that are used to create a specific feature of your
application. Here is a list of some important folders inside the modules folder:

- Api: This folder is used to store the queries, mutations and services that are used to fetch and update data from the backend.
- Constants: This folder is used to store the constants that are used throughout the module.
- Components: This folder is used to store the components that are used throughout the module.
- features: This folder is used to store the features that are used throughout the module.
- routes: This folder is used to store the routes that are used throughout the module.
- stores: This folder is used to store the stores that are used throughout the module.

### Plugins

Plugins are used to add functionality to your Vue.js application. They can be used to add third-party libraries, add
global components, etc.

### Routes

The routes is the core of Vue.js applications. It is used to navigate between different views.

You can read more about it here:

- [Best practices](https://thefrontendbible.com/reusable-code/router)
- [Routes](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/routing.html#basic-routes)

### Stores

Stores are used to store the state of your application. This is useful when you want to share data between different
components. This folder is only for global stores, if you have a store that is only used in a specific component, you
should store it inside the component folder. only global stores should be located in this folder.

You can read more about it here:

- [Best practices](https://thefrontendbible.com/reusable-code/stores)
- [Pinia](https://pinia.esm.dev/)

### Transformers

Transformers are used to transform the data that is received from the backend. This is useful when you want to transform
the data into a format that is easier to work with. This should be a single file per module.

### Transitions

Transitions are used to add animations to your application. This is useful when you want to add a smooth transition
between different views or components.

### Utils

Utils are reusable pieces of code that can be throughout your application.
They contain no state and are not tied to a specific component.

You can read more about it here: [Utils](https://thefrontendbible.com/reusable-code/utils)

### Views

Views are the pages of your application. They are the components that are rendered when a specific route is visited.

You can read more about it here: [Views](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/routing.html#basic-routes)

### Worth mentioning

#### Queries & Mutations (Tanstack)

For fetching data from the backend we use [Vue Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/vue/overview). Vue Query is a Vue plugin that
makes it easy to fetch, cache and update asynchronous data in your components without the hassle of setting up a
dedicated global store.

We also use their mutations to update data in the backend.

You can read more about it here:

- [Best practices queries](https://thefrontendbible.com/reusable-code/queries)
- [Best practices mutations](https://thefrontendbible.com/reusable-code/mutations)

#### Services & Http

Services are used to fetch data from the backend. These backend calls are made using the Http client.

You can read more about it here:

- [Best practices](https://thefrontendbible.com/reusable-code/services)

### Internationalization (i18n)

Locales are used to store the translations of your application. This is useful when you want to support multiple
languages.

You can read more about it here: [Locales](https://thefrontendbible.com/locales)

#### Types & Interfaces

At Wisemen we use Typescript to type all of our code.
This is useful when you want to make sure that your code is correct and leverage the power of intellisense.
It will also help you to avoid bugs, improve your code quality and make your code more readable.

Lastly, your team will be able to understand your code better and don't have to make assumptions about the code.

Consult the front-end bible to find out more about types and interfaces. [For example](https://thefrontendbible.com/components/props#typescript-constructor)

## PROJECT: Battle plan 

Now that we have a basic understanding of the project structure
and the different kinds of elements that a frontend should contain,
let's get started with building the actual application.

1. Before we can create, update and delete todo's, we need to be able to login to the application.
There are several components that we need to create before we can start with the authentication flow. 
2. We will need to create a view that contains a login form. This form will be used to send the login credentials to the
backend. 
3. We will also need to create a service that will be used to send the login request to the backend. 
4. Lastly, we will need to create a store that will be used to store the user information.
After we have created these components, we can start with the authentication flow. 
5. Once the user is logged in, we will need to create a view that contains a list of todo's. 
6. This list will be fetched from the backend and displayed in a list view. 
7. We will also need to create a service that will be used to fetch the todo's from the backend and a store that will be
used to store the todo's. 
8. After we have created these components, we can start with creating todo's. 
9. We will need to create a view that contains a form that can be used to create a new todo. 
10. We will also need to create a service that will be used to send the todo to the backend.

## PROJECT: Http client

The most important aspect of programming is **separation of concerns.** and **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself).
This means that you should separate your code into different layers and files.
This will make your code more readable, reusable and easier to maintain.

You can easily do your calls in the component itself, but this will make your component less readable and harder to
maintain in the future.

That's why we will start with creating a service that will be used to send the login request to the backend.

### Creating the HTTP client

- Add the `axios` package to the project.
- Create a new file called `httpClient.ts` in the `src/http` folder.
- Create a new instance of axios and export it.
- Add an interceptor that will be used to add the `Authorization` header to all requests.

#### Code snippet
```typescript
const httpClient: AxiosInstance = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'ENTER_YOUR_BASE_URL_HERE',
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json;charset=UTF-8',
  },
})
```

### Creating the auth service
- Create a new file called `auth.service.ts` in the `src/modules/auth/services` folder.
- Import the `httpClient` from the `src/http` folder.
- Create a new function called `login` that takes a `username` and `password` as parameters.
- Use the `httpClient` to make a `POST` request to the `/login` endpoint.

```typescript
interface AuthService {
  login: (username: string, password: string) => Promise<void>
  getCurrentUser: () => Promise<CurrentUser>
}

export const authService: AuthService = {
  login: async (username: string, password: string): Promise<AuthTokens> => {
    const formData = encodeQueryData({
      client_id: import.meta.env.VITE_CLIENT_ID,
      client_secret: import.meta.env.VITE_CLIENT_SECRET,
      grant_type: 'password',
      password: password,
      username: username,
    })

    const config = {
      headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'},
    }
    const response = await httpClient.post('/auth/token', formData, config)
    return response.data
  },
  getCurrentUser: async (): Promise<CurrentUser> => {
    const response = await httpClient.get('/users/me')
    return response.data
  },
}
```

💡Don't forget to make a pull request of your work so your buddy can review your code and keep track of your progress. Keeping your PR's small and frequent is a good practice.


## PROJECT: Auth store

### Creating the auth store

The store will help us to save the tokens after a successful login.
That's why we will always use a store to do our backend calls and never directly use the service in the component. (separation of concerns)

- Create a new file called `auth.store.ts` in the `src/modules/auth/stores` folder.
- Import the `auth.service.ts` file.
- Create a new store using the `defineStore` function from `pinia`.
- Add a `accessToken` and `refreshToken` property to the store.
- Add a `login` function to the store that takes a `username` and `password` as parameters.
- Use the `auth.service` to make a `POST` request to the `/login` endpoint.
- Save the `accessToken` and `refreshToken` in the store after a successful login.

> aside positive
> **LIFE PRO TIP**: You can use the [useLocalStorage](https://vueuse.org/core/useStorage/) composable from VueUse to store the user information directly in the local storage.


```typescript
export const useAuthStore = defineStore('auth', () => {
	const currentUser = ref<CurrentUser | null>(null)
    const accessToken = useLocalStorage<string | null>(null)

	const isAuthenticated = computed<boolean>(() => currentUser.value === null)

	async function getCurrentUser(): Promise<CurrentUser> {
		if (currentUser.value !== null) {
			return currentUser.value
		}

        currentUser.value = authService.getCurrentUser()
		return currentUser.value!
	}

	function setCurrentUser(user: CurrentUser | null): void {
		currentUser.value = user
	}

	async function login(data: { email: string; password: string }): Promise<void> {
		const response = await authService.login(data.username, data.password)
        accessToken.value = response.accessToken
	}

	function logout(): void {
		authService.logout()
		setCurrentUser(null)
	}

	return {
		currentUser,
		isAuthenticated,
		getCurrentUser,
		setCurrentUser,
		login,
		logout,
	}
})
```

## PROJECT: Router

The router is the core of Vue.js applications. It is used to navigate between different views.
It is also used to handle authentication and permissions for specific routes using "guards".
This is useful when you want to protect a route from being accessed by unauthenticated users.

### Creating the router

- Create a new file `router.ts` in the `src/router` folder.
- Implement a router using the `createRouter` function from `vue-router`.
- Create empty components called `LoginView.vue` and `TodoView.vue` in the `src/views` folder.
- Add a `login` and `todos` route to the router that lazy loads the `LoginView` and `TodoView` components.

```typescript
const routes: RouteRecordRaw[] = [
  ...AuthenticationRoutes,
  {
    path: '/',
    name: 'index',
    meta: { requiresAuth: true },
    children: [
      // Add your routes here
    ],
  },
  {
    name: 'error',
    path: '/:pathMatch(.*)*',
    component: async () => import('@/views/ErrorNotFoundView.vue'),
  },
]

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes: routes
})
```

### Router guards

- Add a `beforeEach` guard to your router that checks if the user is logged in.
- If the user is not logged in, redirect the user to the `login` route.
- If the user is logged in, continue to the `todos` route.

> aside positive
> TIP: You can use the `useAuthStore` to check if the user is logged in. If the user is not logged in, you can use the `router` to navigate to the `login` route.
> If the user is logged in, you can use the `router` to navigate to the `todos` route.

> aside positive
> TIP: You can add meta fields to your routes to check if the user is allowed to access a specific route.

```typescript
router.beforeEach(async (to, from, next) => {
  // Add your guards here
  
  next()
})
```

💡Don't forget to make a pull request of your work so your buddy can review your code and keep track of your progress. Keeping your PR's small and frequent is a good practice.

## PROJECT: Login view

Now that we have created the store, service and router, we can start with creating the login view.
Views are the "Smart components" in our application. They are allowed to import stores, routers, dumb components, etc.

Our Login view will orchestrate the login flow. It will use the `authStore` to login the user and the `router` to
navigate to the `TodoView` after a successful login.

### Creating your Login view (smart) component

- Create a view called `AuthLoginView.vue` in the `src/modules/auth/views` folder.
- Create a new file called `AuthLoginForm.vue` in the `src/modules/auths/components` folder.
- Add a form that allows the user to enter a `username` and `password`.
- Add the `AuthLoginForm` component to the `AuthLoginView.vue` view.

### Implementing the login flow

- Import the `useAuthStore` and `useRouter` in your `LoginView`.
- Create a new `authStore` and `router` instance.
- Use the `router` to navigate to the `TodoOverviewView.vue` view after successfully logging in.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const authStore = useAuthStore()
  
function handleLogin(data: { username: string; password: string }): void {
  authStore.login(data)
  router.push({ name: 'todos' })
}
</script>

<template>
<AppPage>
    <AuthLoginForm @submit="handleLogin" />
</AppPage>
</template>

## PROJECT: Displaying todo's

Now that we have created the login flow, we can start with creating the todo view.
After completing the login functionality, you should now have a good understanding of how we're going to create the todo view.

### Model
We are going to start by creating a file called `todo.model.ts` in the `src/modules/todos/models` folder.

This file will contain an interface that will represent a single todo with the following properties:
```typescript
export interface Todo {
  uuid: string
  title: string
  description: string
  deadline: string
  isCompleted: boolean
}
```

### Service
After creating the model that we want to use in our frontend, 
we are going to create a file 'todo.service.ts' in the `src/modules/todos/services` folder. 

This service will contain a function `TodoService` that returns another function called `getAll`.

```typescript
interface TodoService {
  getAll: () => Promise<Todo[]>
}

export const authService: AuthService = {
  getAll: async (): Promise<Todo[]> => {
    const response = await httpClient.get('/todos')
    return response.items
  },
}
```

> In a production project we would add an extra object called a "data transfer object" (DTO) 
> so that we can transform the data that is received from the backend into a format that is easier to work with. 

### Query
Next up we are going to create a query called `useTodoIndexQuery`.
This query will be used to call the `getAll` function from our service and fetch the todos from the backend.

The reason we use queries is so that we can easily fetch, cache and update asynchronous data in our components without the hassle of setting up a dedicated global store.

```typescript
export function useTodoIndexQuery() {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: 'todos',
    queryFn: async () => {
      const data = await todoService.getAll()
      return data
    },
  })
}
```

> aside positive
> If you're not sure how to use `useQuery`, you can take a look at the [Vue Query documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/vue/guides/queries).


### List component
Once we have created the query, we can start with creating a list component that will be used to display the todo's.

- Create a `TodoList.vue` (dumb) component in the `src/modules/todos/components` folder.
- Add a list of todo's to the component.
- Add a message when there are no todo's.
- Add a loading state when the todo's are being fetched from the backend.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const props = defineProps<{
  todos: Todo[]
  isLoading: boolean
}>()
</script>

<template>
<div>
  <div v-if="props.todos.length > 0">
    <ul>
      <li v-for="todo in props.todos" :key="todo.uuid">
        {{ todo.title }}
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p v-else> No todo's found </p>
  <p v-if="props.isLoading">Loading...</p>
</div>
</template>
```

### View

The last step is to combine all of our pieces in a (smart) component that will be used to display the todo's.
This file should be named and we will put this in our `src/modules/todos/views` folder.

This view will combine the query and list component we have created before.
```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useTodoIndexQuery } from '@/modules/todos/services/todoIndex.query'

const { data: todos, isLoading } = useTodoIndexQuery()
</script>

<template>
<AppPage>
    <TodoList :todos="todos" :is-loading="isLoading" />
</AppPage>
</template>
```

## PROJECT: Creating Todo's

Now that we have created the todo view and have a list of our existing todo's, we can start with creating new todo's.

The creation of a todo will be done in a modal. This modal will be displayed when the user clicks on the `Create todo`
button.
Modals are allowed to be smart components. The modal will contain a form that allows to enter the required information
for creating a new todo.

### Form model
We are going to start by creating a file called `todoForm.model.ts` in the `src/modules/todos/models` folder.

This file will contain an form schema that will be used to create a new todo
```typescript
export const formSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string(),
  description: z.string(),
  deadline: z.string(),
})

export type TodoForm = z.infer<typeof formSchema>
```

> aside positive
> We use the `zod` library to create a form schema. This library is used to validate and transform data.
> You can read more about it here: [Zod](https://zod.dev/)

### Service
After creating the model that we want to add a new function to our existing service that will be used to create a new todo.

```typescript
interface TodoService {
  ...
  create: (form: TodoForm) => Promise<void>
}

export const todoService: TodoService = {
  ...
  create: async (form: TodoForm): Promise<void> => {
    await httpClient.post('/todos', form)
  },
}
```

### Mutation
Next up we are going to create a mutation called `useTodoCreateMutation`.

This mutation will be used to call the `create` function from our service and create a new todo in the backend.

```typescript
export function useTodoCreateMutation() {
  return useMutation({
    mutationKey: 'createTodo',
    mutationFn: async (form: TodoForm) => {
      await todoService.create(form)
    },
  })
}
```

> aside positive
> If you're not sure how to use `useMutation`, you can take a look at the [Vue Query documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/vue/guides/mutations).

### Modal (smart) component
Once we have created the mutation, we can start with creating a modal component that will be used to create the todo's.

- Create a `TodoModal.vue` (smart) component in the `src/modules/todos/components` folder.
- Add a form that allows the user to enter a `title`, `description` and `deadline`.
- Add a submit button that will call the `useTodoCreateMutation` mutation.

> aside positive
> For more info about form validation you can check out our [Formango](https://github.com/wisemen-digital/vue-formango) library.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const { mutate } = useTodoCreateMutation()

const { onSubmitForm, form } = useForm({
  schema: todoFormSchema,
  defaultValues: {
    title: '',
    description: '',
    deadline: '',
  },
})

const title = form.register('title')
...

onSubmitForm(async (formData: TodoForm) => {
  try {
    await mutate(formData)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
  }
})
</script>

<template>
<AppModal>
    <form @submit="onSubmit(handleSubmit)">
        <input v-model="title.value" />
        ...
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
</AppModal>
```

### View
To finish up, we are going to update our `TodoOverviewView` by adding a button that will open the `TodoModal` when clicked.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
...
const isModalOpen = ref<boolean>(false) 
...
</script>

<template>
<AppPage>
    <TodoList :todos="todos" :is-loading="isLoading" />
    <button @click="onCreateButtonClick">Create todo</button>
    <TodoModal v-if="isModalOpen" @close="handleClose" />
</AppPage>
</template>
```

## PROJECT: Updating and deleting todo's

The last step is to allow the user to update and delete existing todo's. This will be done by clicking on the edit button of a todo.
We are going to extend the functionality of the `TodoModal` component to allow the user to update a todo.
To achieve this, we need to know if the modal is opened in `create` or `update` mode. The easiest way to do this is to
check if a todo uuid is passed to the modal.

### Service
Now it's time to add a new function to our existing service that will be used to update a todo.

```typescript
interface TodoService {
  update: (uuid: TodoUuid, form: TodoForm) => Promise<void>
  deleteByUuid: (uuid: TodoUuid) => Promise<void>
}

export const todoService: TodoService = {
  update: async (uuid: TodoUuid, form: TodoForm): Promise<void> => {
    await httpClient.put(`/todos/${uuid}`, form)
  },
  deleteByUuid: async (uuid: TodoUuid): Promise<void> => {
    await httpClient.delete(`/todos/${uuid}`)
  },
}
```

### Mutation
Once we have added the `update` and `deleteByUuid` functions to our service, we can start with creating the mutations.

```typescript
export function useTodoUpdateMutation() {
  return useMutation({
    mutationKey: 'updateTodo',
    mutationFn: async (uuid: TodoUuid, form: TodoForm) => {
      await todoService.update(uuid, form)
    },
  })
}
```

### Modal (smart) component
Now it's time to extend the functionality of the `TodoModal` component to allow the user to update a todo.

- Add a `uuid` prop to the `TodoModal` component.
- Add a `update` function to the `TodoModal` component that will call the `useTodoUpdateMutation` mutation.
- Add a `delete` function to the `TodoModal` component that will call the `useTodoDeleteMutation` mutation.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const { mutate: update } = useTodoUpdateMutation()
const { mutate: deleteByUuid } = useTodoDeleteMutation()

const props = defineProps<{
  uuid: TodoUuid | null
}>()

const { onSubmitForm, form } = useForm({
  schema: todoFormSchema,
  defaultValues: {
    title: '',
    description: '',
    deadline: '',
  },
})

const title = form.register('title')
...

onSubmitForm(async (formData: TodoForm) => {
  try {
    if (props.uuid) {
      await update(props.uuid, formData)
    } else {
      await mutate(formData)
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
  }
})

function handleDelete(uuid: TodoUuid): void {
  deleteByUuid(uuid)
}

</script>

<template>
<AppModal>
    <form @submit="onSubmit(handleSubmit)">
        <input v-model="title.value" />
        ...
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
    <button @click="handleDelete(props.uuid)">Delete</button>
</AppModal>
</template>
```
